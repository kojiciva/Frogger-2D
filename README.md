# Frogger-2D

Frogger 2D is a vintage game and i have tried to recreate it using OpenGL for my collage project.

The first half of the game is to be played by evading any collision between frog and incoming traffic.

The Second half the frog has to cross the river by jumbing from log to log that are floating above water.

You will have to link the library files that are in Dependencies folder.
